Centralized system for wireless commutation of digital and analog signals.

This is code for slave controllers. For master device see 'wireless-comm-master'.

Warning! The code in this repository has never been tested and was written for educational purposes only.
The only thing that was tested with hardware is SPI_Lib code for MRF49XA RFT module (using STM32F100C6 MCU).

I strongly discourage anyone from using this code as is in their projects. Some pieces might be good though.
